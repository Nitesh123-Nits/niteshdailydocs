## 🧩 Why I Built This

Software engineering is a constant journey.  
Having a personal, organized, and always-deployable knowledge base means:

- Faster recall of concepts  
- Cleaner interview preparation  
- Centralized learning  
- Zero dependency on external note-taking apps  
- Markdown-first → easy to maintain long term  

This site grows as I grow.
